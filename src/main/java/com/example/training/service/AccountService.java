        Note that all logic might be separated into several classes and try to follow Single Responsibility Principle.
        Try to add error handling and exception in some cases, where, you think, it may be appropriate.
        Try to use as much Stream API/Optionals/Lambdas as you can, to try yourself (the easiest way, I think,
        is to write code how you can/cover by tests and then refactor it using lambdas and other Java8 things)
